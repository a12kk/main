## ✨ What is a Fortnite Skin Swapper?

A **Fortnite Skin Swapper** is a program that allows users to change their character's appearance in Fortnite by swapping, unlocking, or customizing skins, emotes, pickaxes, and other cosmetics — without purchasing them from the official store.

### **How does it work?**
- The swapper modifies local Fortnite game files or memory to display different cosmetics.
- You choose any skin or cosmetic from the swapper's library, click "Swap," and launch the game.
- To others, your character may display as the default skin, but you will see your chosen skin in your client.

### **Is it safe/legal?**
- **Risk of Ban:** Using a skin swapper is against Epic Games’ TOS. Your Fortnite account may be PERMANENTLY banned.
- **Malware Risk:** Many swappers on the internet are scams or contain viruses/stealers. Only use trusted open-source projects and scan all files.
- **No Official Support:** Epic Games does not support or endorse any swappers.
